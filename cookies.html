		</p>
		<u>Use of IP addresses and web logs</u>
		<p>
			We may also use your IP address and browser type to help diagnose problems
			with our server, to administer our Website and to improve the service we
			offer to you. An IP address is a numeric code that identifies your
			computer on the internet. Your IP address might also be used to gather
			broad demographic information. <br />
			We may perform IP lookups to determine which domain you are coming from
			(e.g. google.com) to more accurately gauge our users’ demographics. <br />

			usage is not combined with information about you from any other source.

		<p>
			Cookie files can be used to ensure proper display of advertising materials

			sites.
		</p>
		<p>
			A pixel is a line of code which is used by a Website or third party ad
			server to track a user’s activity. The use of a pixel allows us to record
			that a user has visited a particular webpage along with additional
			non-personally identifiable information that the website publisher or
			advertiser may choose to include with the pixel tracking tags. We do not
			collect the online user’s personally identifiable information through our
			pixel tracking tags.
		</p>
		<p>
			These tags are used by our ads server regarding the user’s behaviour and
			usage patterns on advertisements and sites operated by our clients to
			better customize the type of advertisements users see on various sites and
			refers only to non-personally identifiable information of users. We
			believe that the use of these pixel tracking tags enables us and our
			clients to provide users with a more meaningful web experience.
